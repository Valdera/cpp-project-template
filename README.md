# C++ Project Template

- Library, executable and test code separated in distinct folders
- Use of modern CMake for building and compiling
- External libraries installed and managed by
  - CMake's [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html) OR
  - [Conan](https://conan.io/) Package Manager OR
  - [VCPKG](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) Package Manager
- Unit testing using [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
- General purpose libraries: [JSON](https://github.com/nlohmann/json), [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog), [cxxopts](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts) and [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)
- Continuous integration testing with Github Actions and [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- Code coverage reports, including automatic upload to [Codecov](https://codecov.io)
- Code documentation with [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/) and [Github Pages](https://franneck94.github.io/CppProjectTemplate/)

```

Library code goes into [src/](src/), main program code in [app/](app) and tests go in [tests/](tests/).

## Software Requirements

- CMake 3.16+
- GNU Makefile
- Doxygen
- Conan (<= 2) or VCPKG
- MSVC 2017 (or higher), G++9 (or higher), Clang++9 (or higher)
- Code Coverage (only on GNU|Clang): lcov, gcovr
